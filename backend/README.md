# DocSpace - Backend

This directory contains the backend for the DocSpace application, an Express.js server that provides a RESTful API for managing documents, users, and real-time collaboration.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Bun (latest version)
- A Firebase project

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 2. Run the Server

```bash
bun start
```

The server will start on port 5000 by default.

## üß™ Running Tests

To run the tests for the backend, use the following command:

```bash
